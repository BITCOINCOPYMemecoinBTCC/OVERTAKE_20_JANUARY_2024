# OVERTAKE_20_JANUARY_2024
The old Owner was scammed with his main project and his planned ICO unsuccessful for that Reason. At the 20th of January 2024 he where sending me 99,5862% of all Token. 0,3807% of all Token are lost on a old Wallet of him. Last circulation are random Airdrop or very little Wallets. The Token Ownership in the Contract is now mine too.

Now the Token is fully under control of a german longterm traveler and digital nomad, located mostly in Georgia, Tbilisi, a cryptocurrency tax paradise. (I first have had to do with Bitcoin in 2014 and living outside of my Country since 2016) 
Until mid/late mid of this Year i will bring that Token on a good Exchange. A little presale i will organise to fund it. Got already a few interested people and will do it on a legit way.
German + English Telegram Group is already created.
English Telegram Group: https://t.me/BITCOINCOPY_english
German Telegram Group: https://t.me/BITCOINCOPY_deutsch
The new Github i have now created here.
And a very nice Website is already almost fully created and will go online very soon.
Token currently not tradeable. I will bring nothing in circulation until a Listing is negotiated and clarified.
Website will be with me as public and trusted Person. (facebook, linkedin, my english and german youtube get linked on it.
Time for a trusted Memecoin Owner what acting fair.
Best Regards
